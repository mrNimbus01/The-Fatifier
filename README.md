# The Fatifier

_A single capsule. One week. All unecessary  kgs lost. New body, new start._

## Concept
The Fatifier is a hypothetical capsule designed to rapidly reduce body fat over a period of 7 days. Imagine:

- Day 0: 28% body fat  
- Day 2: 20% body fat  
- Day 4: 10% body fat  
- Day 6: 7% body fat

  That's if you're really on the big side. Otherwise, if you're just someone looking to get off christmas  the weight, this is still your solution).

One intake. Maximum effect. Instant transformation.  

**Price Points:** $500,000(minimum) per capsule (limited edition, high-value biotech). You really thought you'd just get this as if its bread? Please.

## Possible Mechanism and Prices ($)
- Nano-tech delivery system  (most likely this one. That fat will disappear in no time.)  - $900,000
- Enzyme-triggered fat conversion (well I mean, it's the standard item.)                  - $500,000 
- Genetic metabolic reprogramming  (changing your DNA? Not really my style, but it ain't coming off the table just yet)  (Potential cost = $1,200,000)

> Totally fictional(well,with the right and enough resources-emphasis on right and enough- I could genuinely do it) .Lemme not say fictional(Its too final). It hasn't been done YET.(well not yet at least).

## Societal Impact
- Fitness, diet, and wellness industries disrupted  (yea all their money will be in my pocket within no time at all)
- Clothing sizes irrelevant  (yea  HEHEHE.Imagine a world where the largest size of clothing you got is medium)
- Influencer culture revolutionized  (yup. All those steroid taking coaches---OUTDONE by actual science. Not lifting a dumbell a  way)
- Black market speculation inevitable  (Better watch out!)

## Future Ideas
- Customized fat-loss schedules  
- Mood or energy enhancements integrated  (still in consideration,but at that point that defeats the whole point of the human experience)
- “Fatifier light” for incremental adjustments  
- Ethical implications and regulation debates  (It will be taken into consideration the fact that one can only take this pill only once in their lifetime)
